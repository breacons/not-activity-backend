# not-activity-backend

## Building and running
This is a `node.js` backend for our awesome Activity game. To run it, please `npm install` and `npm run watch` to serve the API locally. After this, please follow the docs for the frontend to run the game.

## Deployment
Make sure your `gcloud` CLI is logged in and you have selected the project. Run `gcloud app deploy` to deploy the API to App Engine.
